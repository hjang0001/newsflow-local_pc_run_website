            <p class="summary">The harsh conditions in Greenland make it difficult to mine rare earth elements, which are needed for many high-tech products. This challenges President Trump's argument to take control of Greenland. The country's environment, lack of infrastructure, and tough geology make it hard to build a mine. This affects Greenland's economy and the global supply of rare earth elements.</p>

Investors may be deterred from investing in Greenland's mining sector due to the harsh conditions. Students may have fewer career opportunities in Greenland's mining industry. However, it could also lead to more research and development of alternative technologies.</p>
