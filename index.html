            <p class="summary">Google's AI Overview, a feature that provides a summary of search results, was found to give incorrect and potentially harmful medical advice. This was discovered when researchers searched for health-related information. Google has since removed these summaries from medical searches. This means people searching for health information may have been misled and could have been harmed. It affects anyone searching for medical information online, and it's a concern for people's health and well-being.</p>
            <p class="impact"><strong>Impact:</strong> This incident affects citizens who rely on Google for health information, investors who may question Google's ability to provide accurate information, and students who may be learning about health topics online. It highlights the need for accurate and trustworthy sources of information, especially in critical areas like healthcare.</p>

            <p class="summary">The IRS has launched a new online platform for filing information returns. Taxpayers must either use their own software or hire a vendor to navigate the changes and rules. This means taxpayers will have more control over their tax filing process, but also more responsibility. The platform aims to simplify the process, but it may be overwhelming for some.</p>
            <p class="impact"><strong>Impact:</strong> The new platform will affect businesses and individuals who file information returns, such as freelancers, self-employed individuals, and companies with multiple employees. It will require them to invest time and money in software or vendors to ensure accurate and timely filing. This may lead to increased costs and administrative burdens for these groups.</p>
