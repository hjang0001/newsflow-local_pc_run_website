            <p class="summary">The price of oil dropped sharply in 2025, with Brent falling 19% and WTI falling 20%. This happened because there was too much oil being produced and not enough being used, leading to a big surplus. This affects people who rely on oil for transportation, heating, and other uses. It means that oil prices might stay low for a while, which could be good for people who buy gas or use oil-based products.</p>
